    .sub_title What's the challenge?
    %p Refugees often live in displacement for decades, many will never return to their homes. Therefore it's critical to enable them to become economically independent and build a life on their own – in a way that benefits both the refugees and their hosting communities.

    .sub_title The opportunity

    %p There is a huge untapped potential to create shared business opportunities for refugees and host communities.
    %p Think of co-working spaces, shared workshops and joint creation of new services – doing business with each other provides an opportunity to meet, reduce prejudices and improve livelihood.
    %p In Rwanda, refugees enjoy freedom of movement and have the right to work and establish companies.
    %p.bold So how can we create more shared business opportunities between both communities?

    %h2 What’s your solution? Make it matter even more
    %p Do you work with refugees and host community members to connect them through shared economic opportunities, but lack the resources to scale your approach globally?
    %p Do you have a solution in the private or non profit sector to connect refugees and host community members through shared business opportunities and would like to share it?
    %p GIZ gives you the opportunity to work with our network of development experts, designers, and entrepreneurs to scale your solution and make it matter to people that need it most. Submit your solution until [DATE], participate in an innovation lab in Rwanda and prototype your solution together with the local refugee and host community.

            %p Throughout the project you will collaborate closely with a team of designers and development experts to push your solution and adapt it locally. In a one week design workshop in Rwanda, you will prototype an enhanced version of your solution with local experts and members of the refugee and host communities. Travel costs will be covered.
            %p.bold.low_margin Access the expertise of the GIZ network 
            %p You can benefit from the expertise and support of GIZ, Germany’s development agency and its network of experts from leading global and local organisations.

            %p.bold.low_margin Get investment to improve and scale your solution
            %p Once your solution is adapted and enhanced in the innovation lab, together with your new team, you can receive up to 10,000 Euros to run a market-test of your solution in Rwanda.
            %p.bold.low_margin Present your solution to a global network 
            %p You have the chance to see your solution promoted through media, partners and GIZ channels.

    %h2 Why an open call for solutions?
  .half
    %p.bold.low_margin Instead of starting at zero, we want to build on existing knowledge and experience 
    %p We believe that there are people who have solved this challenge before us. Maybe in a different context, maybe with a different focus. None the less, we want to build on these experiences to leapfrog to solutions that we know have potential to make a change.
    %p.bold.low_margin Believing in the skills of others 
    %p As GIZ, we are aware that solutions to this challenge might exist somewhere, created by small or large organisations, start-ups, NGOs or private individual that might not yet be connected to us. We would like to change this by inviting them to participate in an open call for solutions.
  .half
    %p.bold.low_margin Adapting the solutions to align with needs of local communities 
    %p A jury will select the three solutions with the biggest potential, to be tested and adapted on-site to align with the needs of local communities during a design lead workshop and prototyping phase. As an example country, we chose Rwanda. However, the objective is, to scale successful solutions in other countries who combat similar challenges.
    %p.bold.low_margin Pitching to attract investors 
    %p After receiving seed funding from GIZ to develop a first MVP, local teams will pitch their solutions to attract further investment for increasing the impact through scaling.

          At the beginning of 2018, Rwanda took in around 165,000 refugees, mainly from the DR Congo and Burundi. Almost all refugees speak the same as the locals - Kinyarwanda. Around 80% of refugees in Rwanda live in refugee camps. The country is also receiving Rwandan nationals who are returning home after years spent living abroad as refugees.

          The Government of Rwanda and UNHCR are currently implementing a joint strategy for furthering economic development in host communities through refugee self-reliance. The overall objective is for the refugee camps to become places of vibrant social and economic activities with active markets, shops, and industries. Refugees in Rwanda enjoy freedom of movement and have the right to work and establish companies.

The majority of the people in the densely populated country work in low income agriculture. At the same time, the number of young people entering the labor market is constantly growing. Employment promotion is high on the national development agenda.

    %p We don’t want to reinvent the wheel, but build on existing knowledge and experience. You can participate as an NGO, a private individual or a company – as long as your idea has been tested and implemented elsewhere.

    %p.bold.low_margin A solution that can be adapted and handed over.
    %p The solution does not need to be rooted in Rwanda, but needs to have potential to be adapted to fit the local context. The objective is for locals to take ownership and continue adapting it.

    %p.bold.low_margin Do no harm 
    %p We are aware that any intervention could lead to results that are difficult to foresee. We are looking for solutions that are responsible and respectful towards locals and avoid negative impact.


    %p.bold.low_margin Fostering financial self reliance 
    %p We are looking for solutions that help people to lead an independent life providing them with the opportunity of a regular income.


  .half
    %p.bold.low_margin Creating a benefit for refugee and host
    %p We are looking for solutions that are not only focused on supporting refugees, but also provide a benefit to members of host communities and strengthen their relationships.

    %p.bold.low_margin Enabling communities 
    %p The solutions need to respond to people’s needs and work in the local context. We would love to see local people take ownership of the solutions instead of providing a service to them.

    %p.bold.low_margin Potential to scale 
    %p We picked Rwanda as an example. Similar challenges exist in other countries like Jordan, Tanzania or Iraq. We are looking for ideas that have the potential to scale, first in Rwanda, then beyond.

    %p.bold.red Your solution will be a first inspiration to refugee and host communities in Rwanda. If the prototype is successful, GIZ will support to scale the solution globally.

    %p.bold.low_margin Who owns the solution? 
    %p The submitted solution is yours – of course. By sharing your knowledge and experience with host and refugee communities, you will inspire them to adapt the solution to their local context.

    %p.bold.low_margin What happens to my solution after the call?
    %p The moment you participate in the innovation lab, you will become a solution-mentor and be part of the local team of refugees and host community members. After the innovation lab, your team has the chance to pitch your enhanced solution to a jury for further investment.



  .half
    %p Your team can receive up to 10,000 Euro for running a 6 months market-test, that is going to be conducted by the local part of your team and design experts. You can for sure stay remote advisor during that time.
    %p GIZ will make sure to document the market-test, in order to upscale the enhanced solution globally. If your team’s solution will be rolled out on a global scale, you will become a remote solution-advisor.


    %p.bold.low_margin How do refugees and host community members benefit? 
    %p Your experience and the support of GIZ will provide refugees and host communities with an opportunity to become financially independent.

    %p Forming a team and working on new business opportunities together, will bring great benefit to all participants and ensures, that your solutions create a real impact.
