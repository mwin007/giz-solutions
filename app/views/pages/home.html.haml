    .red_title The challenge
    %p Refugees often live in displacement for decades, many will never return to their homes. Therefore is is critical to enable them to become financially independent and build a life on their own – in a way that benefits both the refugees and the communities they now live in.

    .red_title The opportunity

    %p There is a huge untapped potential to create shared business opportunities for refugees and host communities.
    %p Think of co-working spaces, shared workshops and joint creation of new services – doing business with each other provides an opportunity to meet, reduce prejudices and improve one’s livelihood.
    / %p In Rwanda for example, 21% of refugees own a business that employs other people—and 40% of those employees are Rwandan nationals.
    %p So how can we create more shared business opportunities between both communities?

We would like to change this by inviting them to participate in an open call for solutions.

              %p We are aware that any interventions could lead to results that are difficult to foresee. We are looking for solutions that are responsible and respectful towards locals and avoid negative impact.
              %p.bold.low_margin Fostering financial self reliance 
              %p We are looking for solutions that help people to lead an independent life providing them with the opportunity of a regular income.
            .half
              %p.bold.low_margin Creating a benefit for refugee and host
              %p We are looking for solutions that are not only focused on supporting refugees, but also provide a benefit to members of host communities and strengthen their relationships
              %p.bold.low_margin Enabling communities 
              %p The solutions need to respond to people’s needs and work in the local context. We would love to see local people take ownership of the solutions instead of providing a service to them.
              %p.bold.low_margin Potential to scale 
              %p We picked Rwanda as an example. Similar challenges exist in other countries like Jordan, Tanzania or Iraq. We are looking for ideas that have the potential to scale, first in Rwanda than beyond.
