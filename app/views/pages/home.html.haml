    .red_title The challenge
    %p Refugees often live in displacement for decades, many will never return to their homes. Therefore is is critical to enable them to become financially independent and build a life on their own – in a way that benefits both the refugees and the communities they now live in.

    .red_title The opportunity

    %p There is a huge untapped potential to create shared business opportunities for refugees and host communities.
    %p Think of co-working spaces, shared workshops and joint creation of new services – doing business with each other provides an opportunity to meet, reduce prejudices and improve one’s livelihood.
    %p In Kampala for example, 21% of refugees own a business that employs other people—and 40% of those employees are Ugandan nationals.
    %p So how can we create more shared business opportunities between both communities?
